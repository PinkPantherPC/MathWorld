# MathWorld

## What's MathWorld?

MathWolrd is a python module for using sympy with analytic geometry.

Use objects to simulate geometric elements on a 2D plane, such as points, lines, and segments. By using SymPy to define their characteristics, it is possible to utilize MathWorld to solve symbolic problems on the Cartesian plane.

You can check out the documentation in the [repo Wiki](https://github.com/PinkPantherPC/MathWorld/wiki/Documentation)

## Last Release

Compared with version 0.1.0, external functions have been included in classes such as `@staticmethod` and the documentation has been improved for a better approach! I also improved the handling of variables of type float.

You will be able to see more details within the [Github Releases](https://github.com/PinkPantherPC/MathWorld/releases)

## Installation

To install _mathworld_ you can use [pip](https://pypi.org/project/mathworld) (if you already have python installed) by typing the following command in your terminal

```bash
pip install mathworld
```

Alternatively, you can download `MathWorld.zip` from the most recent [Github Release](https://github.com/PinkPantherPC/MathWorld/releases/tag/v0.1.1).

⚠️ **Warning:** Do not download code files directly from the repository, as they are frequently updated. The package might not be functional or properly documented.

## Acknowledgments

This project makes use of [SymPy](https://www.sympy.org), a Python library for symbolic mathematics.

I gratefully acknowledge the developers and contributors of SymPy for their exceptional work in creating and maintaining this robust and versatile computational tool. SymPy is released under the [BSD license](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/blob/master/LICENSE).
